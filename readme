there are two branches, pay more attention to branch mike :

1, master

this demo is from an opensource project : Android Misc Widgets (include SlidingDrawer, Breath Button, and etc)

you can clone the origin code by svn : http://android-misc-widgets.googlecode.com/svn/trunk


2, mike (only include the code and souces for SlidingDrawer) 


Note One: the origin code (SlidingDrawer--Version1)have two bugs:

      1, blink, either when the panel is closed or click the handle
      
      2, when set <uses-sdk> in AndroidManifest.xml, when the panel is closed, click the handle, the handle will disappear.
      
      
solution:
 
         http://blog.csdn.net/lovehong0306/article/details/7451264 (Updated to Version2)
         
      
Note Two: the Version2 still have two bug:
          
      1, when use method panel.setOpen(true, true), the panel can not display animation, the user experence is very bad.
      

solution:

        add separate animation for first opening panel. it's a workround solution. (Update to Version3)
        
        
      2£¬ when touch handle up and down, the panel listener's state is wrong
 
solution: see the commit change
        
        
        
------------------------"Animation"------------------------------

Now the code is updated to Version3, there are two types of the "animation".

1, stardard animation, when use method panel.setOpen(true, true), just run at the first time.

2, onTouchEvent()
       -----GestureDetector()
                ------PanelOnGestureListener()
                          ------onDown()
                          ------onFling()----------invalidate();  
                          ------onScroll()
