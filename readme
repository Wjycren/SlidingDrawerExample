there are two branches:

1, master

this demo is from an opensource project : Android Misc Widgets (include SlidingDrawer, Breath Button, and etc)

you can clone the origin code by svn : http://android-misc-widgets.googlecode.com/svn/trunk


2, mike (only include the code and souces for SlidingDrawer) 


Note: the origin code (SlidingDrawer)have two bugs:

      1, blink, either when the panel is closed or click the handle
      
      2, when set <uses-sdk> in AndroidManifest.xml, when the panel is closed, click the handle, the handle will disappear.
